# Task 1 – Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

## ✨ Task Overview:
This is my first task as a Data Analyst Intern.  
I was given a raw dataset with 100 rows and asked to clean it using Python and Pandas.

## 📄 Dataset Details:
- Name: mall_customers_raw_100.csv
- Issues found: missing values, duplicates, messy gender values (like M, fem, etc.)

## 🔧 What I Did:
1. Removed duplicate rows
2. Fixed gender column (converted all to "male" or "female")
3. Renamed all column names to lowercase
4. Changed age, income, and score columns to numeric
5. Checked and removed missing values using `.isnull()` and `.dropna()`

## 📁 Files I Used:
- mall_customers_raw_100.csv – raw file
- cleaned_mall_customers.csv – after cleaning
- data_cleaning_code.py – code I wrote
- README.md – this file 😊

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Google Colab
- Python (Pandas library)
